K & R Exercises and Examples:
==============================
My takes of **K&amp;R The C Programming Language 2nd edition** book.
It includes both the code **examples** and the **answers** for all the exercises.

###Organization

Each *dir* contains only the code from the specific chapter.

Each example is prefixed with `ex`.

Each exercise is prefixed with the *exercise number* and `ex`.

Some of the answers are inspiered or copied from [clc-wiki](http://clc-wiki.net/wiki/K&R2_solutions).

My code is indented GNU style while the foreign code is indented K&R style.

###Compiling

I suggest using the c99 standard when compiling: `-std=c99` for all the files.
